The Codecademy CSS course got boring, so I started trying to write a site from scratch to learn by doing instead.

I'll probably work more on this, learning more about different aspects of CSS as I progress through different parts
of the site. Or I'll get bored and leave it completely to do something else instead. Who knows.

Either way, while Github Pages confuses the shit out of me and coding is still something I don't feel competent in,
I'm having fun so far and have learnt a lot.

Third Moon is just an imaginary band. It doesn't exist.
